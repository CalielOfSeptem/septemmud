#File Created by Phil Dyer
#because Ken didn't bother to document.

#This file consists of a list of commands to get all the lua crap that Ken used.
#It would be great to put this into CMake, but first things first. We need to know what we 
#are ACTUALLY using.

sudo apt install luarocks
sudo laurocks install ansicolors
