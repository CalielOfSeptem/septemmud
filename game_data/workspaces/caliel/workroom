r:SetDescription("Exquisitely carved shelves of mahogany run the length of a large, two-story study. \z
					Ancient books, scrolls and oddities line the mahogany shelves. \z
					The maw of an over-sized fireplace casts light from a crackling fire to light the room. \z
					A carved wooden ceiling of raised septagonal prisms form a repeating \z
					pattern overhead and seem to absorb firelight at their hollow centers and yawn soft undulating \z 
					hues of gold, brown, and orange. \z
					A massive oaken table with ornately carved runes stands \z
					about the center of the study. Haphazard stacks of leather-bound \z
					volumes extend from the oaken table and remain perilously vertical by some \z
					unnatural force. A few gold-trimmed ancient scrolls lay outstretched \z
					between stacks of the leather-bond volumes and remain taut by \z
					sculpted jade figurines depicting wild beasts which anchor each end. \z
					An oaken door leads south. \z
					A dog-leg staircase ascends to a half-landing before turning at a right angle and continuing upwards \z
					to lead to a second story balcony. ")
